# MemeSignal

MemeSignal is a small exploratory project focused on understanding how memes
and headline-style posts spread on X (Twitter) and Reddit.

The goal is not to predict virality, but to document patterns by manually
reviewing and labeling posts. The project focuses on distinguishing organic
engagement from bait, spam, and coordinated behavior, and on capturing why
certain memes work in specific contexts.

This repository reflects a human-in-the-loop approach where judgment,
consistency, and clear labeling matter more than model complexity.
